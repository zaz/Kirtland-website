		<blockquote>“Caroline felt like one of us and was able to push us hard to make sure she was able to pull the true essence of what we were trying to achieve while maintaining a cohesive and highly collaborative team effort.”
			<cite>Dave Moore, Founder of The Circle Society</cite>
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		“While Caroline is able to bring solid business management skills to almost any challenge (from building a business to growing one), one of her greatest strengths is strategic planning expertise. Through her leadership of strategic planning at JumpStart, she facilitated discussions, create processes, and provided frameworks which enabled the senior management team overall to make the most critical decisions to the health and growth of the business.  I was regularly impressed by her ability to simplify complex problems, to utilize external data and perspective to inform internal decisions, and to do so with a gentle yet firm touch. I look forward to the opportunity to work with Caroline again!”
